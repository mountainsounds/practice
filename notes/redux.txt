***** Reducer *********
A function that takes two arguments:
    1. the app's state of the world
    2. Something that happened

***** Actions *********
The one requirement is that every action declares a type. 
You can include other things, commonly:
    1. payload (either a single value or an object)
    2. meta: other info about the action
     3. error
     
***** Action Creator *********
A very fancy word for a function. It helps remove remove the repeated
boilerplate for creating actions. Saves extra  typing and typo risk.
