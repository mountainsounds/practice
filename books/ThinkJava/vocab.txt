Chapter 1
  1. problem solving: Process of formulating a problem, finding and expressing a solution.
  2. program: A sequence of instructions to a computer about how to perform a task.
  3. programming: Apply problem solving to create executable computer programs.
  4. computer science: The scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications.
  5. algorithm: A precise set of steps for solving a problem, with or without a computer.
  6. bug: An error in a program.
  7. debugging: The process of finding and removing errors.
  8. High-level language: A programming language designed for humans to easily read and write.
  9. Low-level language: A programming language designed to be easy for a computer to run.
        Alternativly called "machine" or "assembly" language.
  10. portable: A programs ability to run on multiple kinds of computers.
  11. interpret: Run a program in a high-level language by translating and immediately executing
        it one line at a time.
  12. compile: To fully translate a program in a high-level language into a low-level language to
        prepare for later execution.
  13. source code: A program in a high-level langauge, before being compiled.
  14. object code: The compiler's output, after translating the program.
  15. executable: Object code that is ready to run on specific hardware.
  16. byte code: A special kind of object code used for Java programs. Similar to a low level language,
        but portable like a high-level language.
  17. statement: Program piece that specifies one step of an algorithm.
  18. print statement: A statement that causes output to be displayed on the screen.
  19. method: A named sequence of statements.
  20. A collection of related methods.
  21. comment: Program peice that contains information about the program, but has no effect when program runs.
  22. string: A sequence of characters; the primary data type for text.
  23. newline: A special character signifying the end of a line of text.
  24. escape sequence: code sequence representing a special character when used inside a string.
