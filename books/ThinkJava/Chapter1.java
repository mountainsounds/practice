*** Exercise 1-1
    1. A comment is text that is ignored by the computer, and intended only for the humans
    reading and writing the program. A statement is a single instruction that the computer is meant 
    to execute. 
    
    2. A program is portable if it can easily be run by different machines and environments. 
    
    3. Compile means to convert source code written by the programmer into machine code that the 
    computer can understand. It prepares a program to be executed in full by a computer. 
    
    4. An executable is source code that has been compiled into object or machine code. It is ready to be 
    run by a computer. When ready, the computer executes the executable, hence why its a noun.
